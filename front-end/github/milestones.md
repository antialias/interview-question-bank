# Github Milestones

Milestones let us know when a code change will be released. Code-reviewers will need to know the milestone so they know when a pull request can be merged.

Github milestones are very important in repositories that have releases! All PR's in these repos should have either a milestone assigned or the `milestone tbd` label.

## Which repos use milestones? 
Any repo that has releases. For example:
* [1stdibs.com](https://github.com/1stdibs/1stdibs.com/)
* [1stdibs-admin-v2](https://github.com/1stdibs/1stdibs-admin-v2/)
* [1stdibs-admin-v1](https://github.com/1stdibs/1stdibs-admin-v1/)
* [bunsen](https://github.com/1stdibs/bunsen/)
* [dibslibs](https://github.com/1stdibs/dibslibs/)

## Which repos don't use milestones?
