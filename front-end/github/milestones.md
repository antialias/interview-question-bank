# Github Milestones

Milestones let us know when a code change will be released. Code-reviewers will need to know the milestone so they know when a pull request can be merged.

Github milestones are very important in repositories that have releases! All PR's in these repos should have either a milestone assigned or the `milestone tbd` label.


## Which repos use milestones? 
Any repo that has releases. For example:
* 1stdibs.com
* 1stdibs-admin-v2
* 1stdibs-admin-v1
* bunsen
* dibslibs
etc

## Which repos don't use milestones?
* mothra
* doctales
* necrodibsicon
etc
