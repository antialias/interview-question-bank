## Gas info

There are two different types of gases used to run Bar 51 - Co2 and G-mix.

Co2 is primarily used for beer. It is used for wine on occasion (more info [below][#wine]). 

The G-Mix, aka beer mix aka 75/25 nitrogen/co2 mix, is used for certain beers, like Guinness or other stouts as well as for the wine.

The kegarator uses a 5# Co2 tank. The winerator uses a 40# or 60# G-Mix tank.

## Beer

We offer a variety of beers at Bar 51. We try not to get the very generic brands (ie. Bud-related beers). The taps are always on a rotating basis depending on what the distributor is carrying that week.

There should be anywhere from one to three beers on tap at all times. If the tap 

We are always open to suggestions if we can get it from the supplier.

## Wine

Bar 51 carries two wines - white and red =). We currently order through [Lieb Cellars][lieb] located at the North Fork on Long Island. They carry different varietals that we can choose from. 

As mentioned above, Co2 is sometimes used for wine but only when we use [key kegs][keykeg]. We can only currently use the [20 slimline][keykeg-20].

However, for the foreseeable future, we have decided to go with wineries that keg their wine with [pubkegs][pubkeg].

Since wine is not carbonated, it uses the G-Mix gas just to push out the liquid. The pressure to shoot for is between 5-8 PSI.
