## qa
The __qa__ environment is a complete 1stdibs stack for qa purposes. The QA team uses this environment to test for upcoming releases. It is powered two load-balanced back-end servers known as `oathkeeper` and `longclaw`. It is accessible outside of the office, protected by password authentication.

## production
Has three backend services: jameson, jack, oldcrow

## fruit servers
are used for front end team to make code available outside of your [devbox](../front-end/devbox.md), to test changes or for product to UAT. These servers do not have their own database or backend services. They will always run against either dev or qa services & data. There are two types of fruit servers. Some fruit servers live on a virtual machine in the office, and some are "perishable" and generated by AWS. To request a fruit server use http://sagan.intranet.1stdibs.com/. You can build a fruit server using the "any fruit server" jenkins job.

You can see all built fruit servers in the sagan directory: http://sagan.intranet.1stdibs.com/directory

## Team/vegetable servers
are complete environments on AWS. Each team has one (money.intranet.1stdibs.com, finding.intranet.1stdibs.com, etc). They have their own server stack, database, and front end. Front end can be built using the "any fruit server" jenkins job.

## thiswillchargeyou
Is another complete environment on AWS. Like the other team/vegetable servers it has its own service layer and test database. The difference is that it uses our PRODUCTION braintree account. Purchases made on thiswillchargeyou will actually charge your credit card! Be careful! We use this environment to test payments methods like PayPal.
