The unifi Wifi controller is located here, it's a vmware server on the esx2 hardware:

**https://192.168.100.197:8443**  
**user:admin**  
**pass:1stdibs123!**  


There are older versions located in:

https://192.168.100.198:8443 (Ubuntu Vmware server running over version)  
https://192.168.100.110:8443 (windows/quickbooks server)

Any of the wifi access points are accessible via ssh using the above mentioned credentials.  If they happen to drop offline and lose their config the default **user/pass is ubnt/ubnt**.  A few helpful commands to bring the WAPs online if they are being problematic:

Login through ssh and access the **mca-cli** util:

BZ.v3.2.12**# mca-cli**  
UniFi**# set-inform https://192.168.100.197:8080/set-inform**   

If this is a new WAP you will need to access the admin utilty at this point and "accept" the new WAP for management.  If you're trying to revive a failed device you can monitor the admin panel to see if the state transitions from Disconnected->Provisioning->Connected.  

You can also run the **'set-inform'** command directly in the ssh session, however I've found the results have been better when running under the **'mca-cli'** shell.  **The WAPs have a known issue** where they can periodically become disconnected and cannot communicate with the controller.  You can see this in the output of **/var/log/messages** which can be helpful when debugging. One helpful trick to overcome this is the modify the** /etc/hosts **file and create a temporary dns entry for 'unifi' pointing to the controller IP:

BZ.v3.2.12**# cat /etc/hosts**  
**127.0.0.1	localhost.localdomain	localhost  
192.168.100.197 unifi**  

After you save the hosts file and if you start tailing /var/log/messages you SHOULD see improved results.  

#### Current Site
Under the current site in the top left corner there are two sites **'51AstorPlace'** and **'51AstorPlace-failover'**.  The idea is that we can apply different policies/configurations and move WAPs between each site with minimal downtime.  At the time of this writing(2015.08.04) all the WAPs are located within **'51AstorPlace-failover'.**
