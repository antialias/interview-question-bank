We have several EC2 servers which are acting as Fastly backend servers to handle content.  For instance Introspective Magazine https://www.1stdibs.com/introspective-magazine/.  In this case we have a Fastly backend host setup pointing to the public AWS Elastic IP 54.173.19.63.  Attached to this backend is a regex which matches against the URL path:

```
req.url ~ "^/introspective-magazine"
```

Server side is pretty straight forward, all we need to do is make sure the home folder is in 
place and ensure we the correct docroot and alias setup:

```
 <VirtualHost *:80>
     DocumentRoot /var/www/introspective/www/
     ServerName www.1stdibs.com
     ServerAlias 1stdibs.com
     Alias /introspective-magazine/ /var/www/introspective/www/

     IndexIgnore *

     ErrorLog /data/logs/httpd/error_log
     ErrorDocument 404 /notfound.html

  <Directory /var/www/introspective/www/>
    allowoverride all
  </Directory>

</VirtualHost>
```

We have the same setup for:
